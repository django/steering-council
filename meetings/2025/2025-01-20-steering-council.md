## Agenda
- Communication/coordination with Fellows
- GSoC
- GitHub repo
- GitHub project for tasks / priorities
- Third party packages discussion

### Communicaton/coordination with Fellows
- Sarah Boyce is going to run through her process as a Fellow as the first steps.
- Perhaps combine meetings to cut down on meetings for Fellows?
  - A few in person meetings with additional people when async functions. 
  - Jeff and Andrew have meetings with them already.
- Relevant [discussion from forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/volunteers-wanted-to-update-triage-workflow-docs/37937/2)
- Potentially want an escalation point of contact with Fellows

### Google Summer of Code
- Bhuvnesh has volunteered to run the administrative side.
- Program has a first deadline of Feb ([timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline))
- Ideal to have projects decided by the end of February. Though that is a tight timeline.
- See items from the [previous roadmap session](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/informal-roadmap-retrospective-workshops-for-django/26835). ([outline of results](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/informal-roadmap-retrospective-workshops-for-django/26835/28))

### GitHub Repo
- [Link](https://github.com/django/steering-council)
- Tim will talk to Mariusz about the GitHub Repo, renaming and making public.

### GitHub Project for Tasks/Priorities
- [Link](https://github.com/orgs/django/projects/19) (is still private)
- GSoC and Third Party Packages moved to Active.
- Processes working currently.

### Third party packages
- Link to djangoproject, jazzband, django ~~community~~ commons.
  - There needs to be discussion of what to link to other than those three.
- Ideally link to ‘strong default’ packages to help new users.
- Maybe yearly roadmapping equivalent? Maybe DSF members have priority in idea suggestion? Some way for ideas to be selected to be shared more publicly on the website.
- Current process is basically for new packages to be posted on the forum to gain attention.
  - Not a lot of the community is not on the forum at the moment.
- Wanting to avoid new, unproven packages being requested for linking frequently and large portions of the steering council meetings being voting on packages.
- Perhaps have someone write a blog post for djangoproject.com about ‘these are the packages I use most’ as advice for newer users.
- The goal is to have packages more easy to find for new users, whether they are popular packages, or packages that have a very specific use
- Steering council members making lists of packages they would like to see linked. 
  - Need to verify community engagement, which could mean looking at longstanding public discussions.
  - Can look at JetBrains survey results, though the list on that survey might not be extensive.
    - DSF board member will specifically have ownership of the JetBrains survey, and talking with the steering council will be part of that.
  - Could ask on social media.
- Should only free resources should be linked, or paid as well?
- Should there be a discussion about sponsored placements?

## Action Items
- Frank: Reach out to Fellows to see what they would like.
- Tim: Reach out to Bhuvnesh to see what support he would like for GSoC.
- Tim: Talk to Mariusz about the GitHub Repo, renaming and making public.
- Steering Council members make lists of packages and other content they would like to see linked.
