### Future of admin

- The admin is a very desirable part of Django, but it’s user experience for developers can be difficult.
- The admin is the second largest source of open tickets in Django, about 10-15% of the total tickets. Carlton warns that a rewrite is difficult, and there are so many hooks already.
- There may be a lot of inertia issues with admin tickets not moving, which he believes is why there’s a large pileup.
- An admin rewrite would be difficult, but may be the best way forward.
    - Rebuild could have a focus on ease of testing moving forward.
    - Would this be part of core, or not?
- Make sure that the naming conventions are made with the future in mind.
- Need to make it clear that the Admin is something that it should be clear that the DSF will maintain for at least the next five years, with the intention of it being longer. 


### Requesting additional Fellows from DSF Board

- Need to be cautious about scope creep for Fellows responsibilities
- There's sustainability concerns if funding decreases in the future and have increased number of Fellows
    - Decreasing from theoretically 4 to 2 fellows could be managed with expectations set.
- Want to ask Fellows how their time is allocated and also how their stress is allocated.
- Security may be an easier sell to companies, to having another funded Fellow
