### Teams to Working Groups update

- Accessibility team WG PR: https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/pull/34 
- Created PR to create team template for WG and remove requirement of board liaison https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/pull/36
- Fellows needs:
    1. How to contact
    2. Is there a person in charge/ designated contact?
    3. What are they doing? Particularly anything not documented.
    4. What are the expectations for them?
        - Need to be careful about being too aggressive here
        - Could experiment with active and inactive membership
        - Could make it easy to rejoin
        - Could have time frames and regular times for people to step on and off, like a year commitment
        - Need succession planning for key volunteers


### New feature idea process update

- The question “Can we do this?” feels like the DEP process
- Want to have a POC of this for DjangoCon Europe
- Clarification on the role of the Forum and GitHub with the process
    - Some discussions will definitely start on the Forum
    - Doesn’t want to overwhelm the Forum
    - Moderation will need to be via a bot to make it anonymous
- Discussion around currrent new ideas
    - CSP
    - Django Tasks
    - Composite primary keys iterative work
    - GSoC projects

### Sovereign Tech Fund

- Brief discussion about past and upcoming discussions with Lexi.
- Everyone’s current understanding is that the money would go through Lexi’s company.
- They have been successful in applying before.
- DSF or other companies could apply as well
