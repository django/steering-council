  - Can we improve APIs? Explicit plugin API? 
- Carlton would like to designate between what can be done in the short, medium, and long term. 
- Discussion about state of async work
- Should we have a community / office hours type discussion about the scope of Django? 
- Discussion about whether or not Django Survey reaches enough of the community to be a barometer
