## Agenda

- Contributor experience around new features

### Contributor experience around new features

- Need to determine concrete next steps
- Categorize the pain points of user experience.
  - Visibility is a problem. Either a library created has little visibility, or the creator spends a large amount of time marketing their library.
- Tagging is a possibility for Forum sorting.
- Making a Github tracker to in some way track features. Give structure to help users. Potentially a wizard. Also Github issue templating can be used.
- Using bots, especially for things like duplicates.
- Work on setting correct expectations. Especially around CoC, but also in other things.
- Should we allow people to open draft PRs
  - Potentially problematic for Fellows or active developers
  - Try to slow people down and get community input on large ideas before huge amount of work is put into it.
  - People may be more likely to be logged into GitHub, so they might see more feedback and interaction based on it being Github rather than Trac.
- How do we allow people to track the bits of Django that they’re interested in?
- Personas for contribution (Note, people can fall into multiple categories)
  - Have a particular itch
    - I want one thing changed and I’ll be happy
    - Uses Django for work
  - I want credit / recognition
    - I want to be involved so I can put it on the resume?
    - Tend to be new to OSS
  - Regular OSS contributor
    - Could be involved in several projects
    - May have a particular area of focus
    - Might use frameworks other than Django regularly, but might not.
  - Django Library Maintainer- could be combined with above
    - Going to be coming back with bugs and issues.
    - More interested in keeping Django Running.
  - Django evangelist
    - Convinced their company to use Django
    - May be willing to fund a new feature
  - Django Subject Matter Expert
    - People who are regularly contributing
    - Can be relied on as a subject matter expert
  - Translator/ Helper
    - They want to help with someone else’s project.
    - They might have a particular interest like translation.
  - Linux Distro maintainer
    - Need help understanding this role
  - Content creator?
    - Author, podcaster, tutorial creator, video creator, tiktoker
    - Would need to update materials on changes
    - People who are talking about relevant software
    - They actually have motivation for Django to not have major changes.
    - Should readers be informed about what version it works for? Sometimes nothing changes with a new version and the tutorial is still applicable, sometimes it’s not.
  - Business owner/employee
    - They also do not want Django to change.
    - Every change, they have to pay time or money whenever there is a significant update.
