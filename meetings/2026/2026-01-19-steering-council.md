### Actions Review

- FOSDEM is next week, Sovereign Tech Fund and Emma will be there, she’s going to try to talk with them
- Emma is presenting on django-admin-deux!
- On django-tasks backends
    - Couldn’t find a redis one
    - Cron integration, it was shared on mastodon
- Goals next 2026
    - There’s a bunch of parallel items identified
    - Some discussion of items on the private thread.
    - Need to wait for Carlton to propose annual release cycle DEP to discuss in detail.
        - There is also a potential need to consult with Fellows
        - Should check on past contributors who advocating not using an annual release


### New features review 

- Modern CSRF feature
    - https://github.com/django/new-features/issues/98
    - General consensus in Slack
    - Does this need more discussion or a vote?
    - Does someone want to announce that it has been moved on?
    - Emma volunteered to do a write up.
    - Do we want to use this as a model going forward? Do we want to do additional documentation or a full or simplified DEP? Simplified DEP referring to the Steering Council doing the majority of the work, and also that it can be a shorter write up.
- Static exporter for Django feature
    - https://github.com/django/new-features/issues/96
    - This also seems a supported request.
    - Is this a good candidate to move forward as well?
    - Mentioned in 2025-11-17 Steering Council
    - Is there enough community engagement/desire for this feature?
    - Should the steering council do more to try to raise community engagement before there is a decision on this one?
